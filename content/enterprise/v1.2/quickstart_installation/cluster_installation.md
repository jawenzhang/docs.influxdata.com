InfluxEnterprise offers highly scalable clusters on your infrastructure
and a management UI for working with clusters.
The QuickStart Installation process will get you up and running with your
InfluxEnterprise cluster.

> The QuickStart Installation process **is not** designed for use
in a production environment.
Follow the instructions outlined in the [Production Installation](/enterprise/v1.2/production_installation/) section
if you wish to use InfluxEnterprise in a production environment.
Please note that if you install InfluxEnterprise with the QuickStart Installation process you
will need to reinstall InfluxEnterprise with the Production Installation
process before using the product in a production environment.

## Setup Description and Requirements

### Setup Description

The QuickStart Installation process sets up an InfluxEnterprise cluster on three servers.
Each server is a [meta node](/enterprise/v1.2/concepts/glossary/#meta-node) and
a [data node](/enterprise/v1.2/concepts/glossary/#data-node), that is, each server
runs both the [meta service](/enterprise/v1.2/concepts/glossary/#meta-service)
and the [data service](/enterprise/v1.2/concepts/glossary/#data-service).

### Requirements

#### License Key or File

InfluxEnterprise requires a license key **OR** a license file to run.
Your license key is available at [InfluxPortal](https://portal.influxdata.com/licenses).
Contact support at the email we provided at signup to receive a license file.
License files are required only if the nodes in your cluster cannot reach
`portal.influxdata.com` on port `80` or `443`.

#### Networking

Meta nodes and data nodes communicate over ports `8088`,
`8089`, and `8091`.

For licensing purposes, meta nodes and data nodes must also be able to reach `portal.influxdata.com`
on port `80` or `443`.
If the nodes cannot reach `portal.influxdata.com` on port `80` or `443`,
you'll need to set the `license-path` setting instead of the `license-key`
setting in the meta node and data node configuration files.

#### Load Balancer

InfluxEnterprise does not function as a load balancer.
You will need to configure your own load balancer to send client traffic to the
data nodes on port `8086` (the default port for the [HTTP API](/influxdb/v1.2/tools/api/)).

## Step 1: Modify the /etc/hosts file

Add your three servers' hostnames and IP addresses to **each** server's `/etc/hosts`
file (the hostnames below are representative).
Note that in versions prior to v1.2.2, hostnames **must** be all lowercase.

```
<Server_1_IP> quickstart-cluster-01
<Server_2_IP> quickstart-cluster-02
<Server_3_IP> quickstart-cluster-03
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Before proceeding with the installation, verify on each server that the other
servers are resolvable. Here is an example set of shell commands using `ping`:
>
    ping -qc 1 quickstart-cluster-01
    ping -qc 1 quickstart-cluster-02
    ping -qc 1 quickstart-cluster-03


If there are any connectivity issues please resolve them before proceeding with the
installation.
A healthy cluster requires that every meta node and data node can communicate with every other
meta node and data node.

## Step 2: Set up the Meta Nodes

Perform the following steps on all three servers.

### I. Download and Install the Meta Service


#### Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta_1.2.4-c1.2.4_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-meta_1.2.4-c1.2.4_amd64.deb
```
#### RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)]
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta-1.2.4_c1.2.4.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-meta-1.2.4_c1.2.4.x86_64.rpm
```

### II. Edit the Meta Service Configuration File

In `/etc/influxdb/influxdb-meta.conf`:

* uncomment and set `hostname` to the full hostname of the meta node
* set `registration-enabled` in the `[enterprise]` section to `true`
* set `registration-server-url` in the `[enterprise]` section to the full URL of the server that will run the InfluxEnterprise web console.
You must fully specify the protocol, IP or hostname, and port.
Entering the IP or hostname alone will lead to errors.
* set `license-key` in the `[enterprise]` section to the license key you received on InfluxPortal **OR** `license-path` in the `[enterprise]` section to the local path to the JSON license file you received from InfluxData. The `license-key` and `license-path` settings are mutually exclusive and one must remain set to the empty string.

```
# Hostname advertised by this host for remote addresses.  This must be resolvable by all
# other nodes in the cluster
hostname="<quickstart-cluster-0x>" #✨

[enterprise]
  # Must be set to true to use the Enterprise Web UI
  registration-enabled = true #✨

  # Must include the protocol (http://)
  registration-server-url = "http://<web-console-server-IP>:3000" #✨

  # license-key and license-path are mutually exclusive, use only one and leave the other blank
  license-key = "<your_license_key>" #✨ mutually exclusive with license-path

  # license-key and license-path are mutually exclusive, use only one and leave the other blank
  license-path = "/path/to/readable/JSON.license.file" #✨ mutually exclusive with license-key
```

### III. Start the Meta Service

On sysvinit systems, enter:
```
service influxdb-meta start
```

On systemd systems, enter:
```
sudo systemctl start influxdb-meta
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Check to see that the process is running by entering:
>
    ps aux | grep -v grep | grep influxdb-meta
>
You should see output similar to:
>
    influxdb  3207  0.8  4.4 483000 22168 ?        Ssl  17:05   0:08 /usr/bin/influxd-meta -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb-meta.conf

## Step 3: Set up the Data Nodes

Perform the following steps on all three servers.

### I. Download and Install the Data Service

#### Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.2.4-c1.2.4_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.2.4-c1.2.4_amd64.deb
```
#### RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.2.4_c1.2.4.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.2.4_c1.2.4.x86_64.rpm
```

### II. Edit the Data Service Configuration File

First, in `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`, uncomment:

* `hostname` at the top of the file and set it to the full hostname of the data node
* `auth-enabled` in the `[http]` section and set it to `true`
* `shared-secret` in the `[http]` section and set it to a long pass phrase that will be used to sign tokens for intra-cluster communication. The Enterprise Web console requires this to be consistent across all data nodes.

Second, in `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`, set:

`license-key` in the `[enterprise]` section to the license key you received on InfluxPortal **OR** `license-path` in the `[enterprise]` section to the local path to the JSON license file you received from InfluxData. The `license-key` and `license-path` settings are mutually exclusive and one must remain set to the empty string.

```
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
# reporting-disabled = false
# bind-address = ":8088"
hostname="<quickstart-cluster-0x>" #✨

[enterprise]
  registration-enabled = false

  registration-server-url = ""

  # license-key and license-path are mutually exclusive, use only one and leave the other blank
  license-key = "<your_license_key>" #✨ mutually exclusive with license-path

  # The path to a valid license file.  license-key and license-path are mutually exclusive,
  # use only one and leave the other blank.
  license-path = "/path/to/readable/JSON.license.file" #✨ mutually exclusive with license-key

[meta]
  # Where the cluster metadata is stored
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta" # data nodes do require a local meta directory

[...]

[http]
  # Determines whether HTTP endpoint is enabled.
  # enabled = true

  # The bind address used by the HTTP service.
  # bind-address = ":8086"

  # Determines whether HTTP authentication is enabled.
  auth-enabled = true #✨ this is recommended but not required

[...]

  # The JWT auth shared secret to validate requests using JSON web tokens.
  shared-secret = "long pass phrase used for signing tokens" #✨
```

### III. Start the Data Service
On sysvinit systems, enter:
```
service influxdb start
```

On systemd systems, enter:
```
sudo systemctl start influxdb
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Check to see that the process is running by entering:
>
    ps aux | grep -v grep | grep influxdb
>
You should see output similar to:
>
    influxdb  2706  0.2  7.0 571008 35376 ?        Sl   15:37   0:16 /usr/bin/influxd -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf
>
If you do not see the expected output, the process is either not launching or is exiting prematurely. Check the [logs](/enterprise/v1.2/administration/logs/) for error messages and verify the previous setup steps are complete.

## Step 4: Join the Nodes to the Cluster

### I. Join the first Server to the Cluster
On the first server (`quickstart-cluster-01`), join its meta node and data node
to the cluster by entering:
```
influxd-ctl join
```

The expected output is:
```
Joining meta node at localhost:8091
Searching for meta node on quickstart-cluster-01:8091...
Searching for data node on quickstart-cluster-01:8088...

Successfully created cluster

  * Added meta node 1 at quickstart-cluster-01:8091
  * Added data node 2 at quickstart-cluster-01:8088

  To join additional nodes to this cluster, run the following command:

  influxd-ctl join quickstart-cluster-01:8091
```

### II. Join the second Server to the Cluster
On the second server (`quickstart-cluster-02`), join its meta node and data node
to the cluster by entering:
```
influxd-ctl join quickstart-cluster-01:8091
```

The expected output is:
```
Joining meta node at quickstart-cluster-01:8091
Searching for meta node on quickstart-cluster-02:8091...
Searching for data node on quickstart-cluster-02:8088...

Successfully joined cluster

  * Added meta node 3 at quickstart-cluster-02:8091
  * Added data node 4 at quickstart-cluster-02:8088
```

### III. Join the third Server to the Cluster
On the third server (`quickstart-cluster-03`), join its meta node and data node
to the cluster by entering:
```
influxd-ctl join quickstart-cluster-01:8091
```

The expected output is:
```
Joining meta node at quickstart-cluster-01:8091
Searching for meta node on quickstart-cluster-03:8091...
Searching for data node on quickstart-cluster-03:8088...

Successfully joined cluster

  * Added meta node 5 at quickstart-cluster-03:8091
  * Added data node 6 at quickstart-cluster-03:8088
```

### IV. Verify your Cluster
On any server, enter:
```
influxd-ctl show
```

The expected output is:
```
Data Nodes
==========
ID   TCP Address                  Version
2    quickstart-cluster-01:8088   1.2.4-c1.2.4
4    quickstart-cluster-02:8088   1.2.4-c1.2.4
6    quickstart-cluster-03:8088   1.2.4-c1.2.4

Meta Nodes
==========
TCP Address                  Version
quickstart-cluster-01:8091   1.2.4-c1.2.4
quickstart-cluster-02:8091   1.2.4-c1.2.4
quickstart-cluster-03:8091   1.2.4-c1.2.4
```

Your cluster should have three data nodes and three meta nodes.
If you do not see your meta or data nodes in the output, please retry
adding them to the cluster.

Once all of your nodes are joined to the cluster, move on to the [next step](/enterprise/v1.2/quickstart_installation/web_console_installation/)
in the QuickStart Installation to set up the InfluxEnterprise web console.
