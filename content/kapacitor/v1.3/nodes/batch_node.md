A node that handles creating several child QueryNodes. 
Each call to `query` creates a child batch node that 
can further be configured. See [QueryNode](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/query_node/) 
The `batch` variable in batch tasks is an instance of 
a [BatchNode.](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/batch_node/) 

Example: 


```javascript
     var errors = batch
                      |query('SELECT value from errors')
                      ...
     var views = batch
                      |query('SELECT value from views')
                      ...
```

Available Statistics: 

* query_errors -- number of errors when querying 
* batches_queried -- number of batches returned from queries 
* points_queried -- total number of points in batches

### Properties


### Chaining Methods

-	[Deadman](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/batch_node/#deadman)
-	[Query](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/batch_node/#query)
-	[Stats](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/batch_node/#stats)

Chaining Methods
----------------

Chaining methods create a new node in the pipeline as a child of the calling node.
They do not modify the calling node.
Chaining methods are marked using the `|` operator.


### Deadman

Helper function for creating an alert on low throughput, a.k.a. deadman&#39;s switch. 

- Threshold -- trigger alert if throughput drops below threshold in points/interval. 
- Interval -- how often to check the throughput. 
- Expressions -- optional list of expressions to also evaluate. Useful for time of day alerting. 

Example: 


```javascript
    var data = stream
        |from()...
    // Trigger critical alert if the throughput drops below 100 points per 10s and checked every 10s.
    data
        |deadman(100.0, 10s)
    //Do normal processing of data
    data...
```

The above is equivalent to this 
Example: 


```javascript
    var data = stream
        |from()...
    // Trigger critical alert if the throughput drops below 100 points per 10s and checked every 10s.
    data
        |stats(10s)
            .align()
        |derivative('emitted')
            .unit(10s)
            .nonNegative()
        |alert()
            .id('node \'stream0\' in task \'{{ .TaskName }}\'')
            .message('{{ .ID }} is {{ if eq .Level "OK" }}alive{{ else }}dead{{ end }}: {{ index .Fields "emitted" | printf "%0.3f" }} points/10s.')
            .crit(lambda: "emitted" <= 100.0)
    //Do normal processing of data
    data...
```

The `id` and `message` alert properties can be configured globally via the &#39;deadman&#39; configuration section. 

Since the [AlertNode](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/alert_node/) is the last piece it can be further modified as usual. 
Example: 


```javascript
    var data = stream
        |from()...
    // Trigger critical alert if the throughput drops below 100 points per 10s and checked every 10s.
    data
        |deadman(100.0, 10s)
            .slack()
            .channel('#dead_tasks')
    //Do normal processing of data
    data...
```

You can specify additional lambda expressions to further constrain when the deadman&#39;s switch is triggered. 
Example: 


```javascript
    var data = stream
        |from()...
    // Trigger critical alert if the throughput drops below 100 points per 10s and checked every 10s.
    // Only trigger the alert if the time of day is between 8am-5pm.
    data
        |deadman(100.0, 10s, lambda: hour("time") >= 8 AND hour("time") <= 17)
    //Do normal processing of data
    data...
```



```javascript
node|deadman(threshold float64, interval time.Duration, expr ...ast.LambdaNode)
```

Returns: [AlertNode](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/alert_node/)


### Query

The query to execute. Must not contain a time condition 
in the `WHERE` clause or contain a `GROUP BY` clause. 
The time conditions are added dynamically according to the period, offset and schedule. 
The `GROUP BY` clause is added dynamically according to the dimensions 
passed to the `groupBy` method. 


```javascript
node|query(q string)
```

Returns: [QueryNode](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/query_node/)


### Stats

Create a new stream of data that contains the internal statistics of the node. 
The interval represents how often to emit the statistics based on real time. 
This means the interval time is independent of the times of the data points the source node is receiving. 


```javascript
node|stats(interval time.Duration)
```

Returns: [StatsNode](/kapacitor/v1.3/nodes/stats_node/)
